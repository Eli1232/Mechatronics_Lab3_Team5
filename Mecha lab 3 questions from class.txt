Questions from class

Charger?
	We have an adaptor to run arduino off the wall. Don't charge the battery with it. 
More acrylic?
	Finish your existing acrylic, then you can ask for more
When can we come in and work on it outside of our lab section?
	Any time except when E and I is working (Thu and fri afternoon, come in morning or evening). Can even come during other mechatronic lab sections mon-wed. 
 
Demo a working robot at some point next lab. Can finish early and leave early. Should get it working before that. 
There will be post lab report.
